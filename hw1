1.	www.prosource.net

Target Audience: Health conscious people or people looking to get in better
shape
 
 The golden ratio is used on the left and right sides to keep the content
 focused in the center
 2.	www.ign.com

  The golden ratio is again used on either side of the content to create a
  centered focus

  3.	www.eat24hours.com
  Target audience: Customers looking for places to eat in their current area
  and who are looking for convenient all in one online ordering

   

   The golden ratio is once again used on the sides of the main content area

   4.	http://www.livenation.com/

   Target audience: users looking for information on concerts and events in
   their area and also users looking to purchase tickets to those events

     
     Live nation takes more of a billboard approach design but still uses the
     golden ratio to keep the user focused on what is important on the site

     5.	http://www.target.com/

     Target audience: customers looking to view, purchase, and reserve items
     sold at targets in their area

      

      Again we see the golden ratio used on either side of the site content to
      keep the page clean and easy to view
